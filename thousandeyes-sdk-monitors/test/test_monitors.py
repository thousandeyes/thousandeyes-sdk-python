    BGP Monitors API

     Retrieve information about BGP monitors available to your ThousandEyes account. ThousandEyes ingests BGP routing data from dozens of global BGP collectors and automatically integrates that visibility as a configurable layer under service, network, and path visualization layers.  When you specify a service URL in a test, layered BGP tests automatically track reachability and path changes for any relevant prefix. When you use an IP address as the target for a test, the ThousandEyes platform monitors the relevant internet-routed prefix. You can also create specific BGP monitoring for a prefix, and can alert on hijacks and leaks.  For more information about monitors, see [Inside-Out BGP Visibility](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/bgp-tests/inside-out-bgp-visibility).
