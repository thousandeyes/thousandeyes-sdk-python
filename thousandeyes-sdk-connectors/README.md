from thousandeyes_sdk.core.exceptions import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7"
)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with thousandeyes_sdk.core.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = thousandeyes_sdk.connectors.GenericConnectorsApi(api_client)
    generic_connector = thousandeyes_sdk.connectors.GenericConnector() # GenericConnector | 
    aid = 123456 # float | Account ID (optional)

    try:
        # Create connector
        api_response = api_instance.create_generic_connector(generic_connector, aid=aid)
        print("The response of GenericConnectorsApi->create_generic_connector:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
