# thousandeyes-sdk-alerts
You can manage the following alert functionalities on the ThousandEyes platform using the Alerts API:

* **Alerts**: Retrieve alert details. Alerts are assigned to tests through alert rules.

* **Alert Rules**: Conditions that you configure in order to highlight or be notified of events of interest in your ThousandEyes tests. When an alert ruleâ€™s conditions are met, the associated alert is triggered and the alert becomes active. It remains active until the alert is cleared. Alert rules are reusable across multiple tests..

* **Alert Suppression Windows**: Suppress alerts for tests during periods such as planned maintenance. Windows can be one-time events or recurring events to handle periodic occurrences such as monthly downtime for maintenance.

For more information about the alerts, see [Alerts](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts).

## Getting Started

Please follow the installation procedure and then run the following:

```python

import thousandeyes_sdk.core
import thousandeyes_sdk.alerts
from thousandeyes_sdk.core.exceptions import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with thousandeyes_sdk.core.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = thousandeyes_sdk.alerts.AlertRulesApi(api_client)
    rule_detail_update = thousandeyes_sdk.alerts.RuleDetailUpdate() # RuleDetailUpdate | 
    aid = '1234' # str | A unique identifier associated with your account group. You can retrieve your `AccountGroupId` from the `/account-groups` endpoint. Note that you must be assigned to the target account group. Specifying this parameter without being assigned to the target account group will result in an error response. (optional)

    try:
        # Create alert rule
        api_response = api_instance.create_alert_rule(rule_detail_update, aid=aid)
        print("The response of AlertRulesApi->create_alert_rule:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling AlertRulesApi->create_alert_rule: %s\n" % e)

```
