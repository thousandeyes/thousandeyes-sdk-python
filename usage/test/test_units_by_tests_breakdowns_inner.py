    Usage API

     These usage endpoints define the following operations:  * **Usage**: Retrieve usage data for the specified time period (default is one month).          * Users must have the `View Billing` permission to access this endpoint.     * This endpoint offers visibility across all account groups within the organization.     * Users with `View Billing` permission in multiple organizations should query the endpoint with the `aid` query string parameter (see optional parameters) for each organization.  * **Quotas**: Obtain organization and account usage quotas. Additionally, users with the appropriate permissions can create, update, or delete these quotas.          * Users must have the necessary permissions to perform quota-related actions.  Refer to the Usage API endpoints for detailed usage instructions and optional parameters.
