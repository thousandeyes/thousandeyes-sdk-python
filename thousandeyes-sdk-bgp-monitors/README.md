# thousandeyes-sdk-bgp-monitors

Retrieve information about BGP monitors available to your ThousandEyes account. ThousandEyes ingests BGP routing data from dozens of global BGP collectors and automatically integrates that visibility as a configurable layer under service, network, and path visualization layers.

When you specify a service URL in a test, layered BGP tests automatically track reachability and path changes for any relevant prefix. When you use an IP address as the target for a test, the ThousandEyes platform monitors the relevant internet-routed prefix. You can also create specific BGP monitoring for a prefix, and can alert on hijacks and leaks.

For more information about monitors, see [Inside-Out BGP Visibility](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/bgp-tests/inside-out-bgp-visibility).

```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install thousandeyes-sdk-bgp-monitors`)

Then import the package:
```python
import thousandeyes_sdk.bgp_monitors
```

### Setuptools

Then import the package:
```python
import thousandeyes_sdk.bgp_monitors
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the installation procedure and then run the following:

```python

import thousandeyes_sdk.core
import thousandeyes_sdk.bgp_monitors
from thousandeyes_sdk.core.exceptions import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with thousandeyes_sdk.core.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = thousandeyes_sdk.bgp_monitors.BGPMonitorsApi(api_client)
    aid = '1234' # str | A unique identifier associated with your account group. You can retrieve your `AccountGroupId` from the `/account-groups` endpoint. Note that you must be assigned to the target account group. Specifying this parameter without being assigned to the target account group will result in an error response. (optional)

    try:
        # List BGP monitors
        api_response = api_instance.get_bgp_monitors(aid=aid)
        print("The response of BGPMonitorsApi->get_bgp_monitors:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling BGPMonitorsApi->get_bgp_monitors: %s\n" % e)

```
