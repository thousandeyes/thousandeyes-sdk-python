    Tags API

    The ThousandEyes Tags API provides a tagging system with key/value pairs. It allows you to tag assets within the ThousandEyes platform (such as agents, tests, or alert rules) with meaningful metadata. For example: `branch:sfo`, `branch:nyc`, and `team:netops`.  This feature provides:  * Support for automation. * Powerful and flexible reports/dashboards. * Support for third-party integrations.  Things to note with the ThousandEyes Tags API:  * Tags are backwards-compatible with existing labels. * Tags are separated by Tests (CEA), Agents (CEA), Endpoint Agents, Scheduled Endpoint Tests, and Reports. A single tag can only apply to one type of target object, so each tag must specify the target type of object via a `type` field. * Tags are defined in a single table so that they can be represented using a single model - `Tag`.
