# thousandeyes-sdk-streaming
ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry provides machine-to-machine integration between ThousandEyes and its customers. It allows you to export ThousandEyes telemetry data in OTel format, which is widely used in the industry. With ThousandEyes for OTel, you can leverage frameworks widely used in the observability domain - such as Splunk, Grafana, and Honeycomb - to capture and analyze ThousandEyes data. Any client that supports OTel can use ThousandEyes for OpenTelemetry.

ThousandEyes for OTel is made up of the following components:

* Data streaming APIs that you can use to configure and enable your ThousandEyes tests with OTel-compatible streams,
in particular to configure how ThousandEyes telemetry data is exported to client integrations.
* A set of streaming pipelines called _collectors_ that actively fetch ThousandEyes network test data, enrich the data with some additional
detail, filter, and push the data to the customer-configured endpoints, depending on what you configure via the public APIs.
* Third-party OTel collectors that receive, transform, filter, and export different metrics to client applications such as AppD, or any other OTel-capable client
configuration.

```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the installation procedure and then run the following:

```python

import thousandeyes_sdk.core
import thousandeyes_sdk.streaming
from thousandeyes_sdk.core.exceptions import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with thousandeyes_sdk.core.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = thousandeyes_sdk.streaming.StreamingApi(api_client)
    aid = '1234' # str | A unique identifier associated with your account group. You can retrieve your `AccountGroupId` from the `/account-groups` endpoint. Note that you must be assigned to the target account group. Specifying this parameter without being assigned to the target account group will result in an error response. (optional)
    stream = thousandeyes_sdk.streaming.Stream() # Stream | Stream to configure (optional)

    try:
        # Create data stream
        api_response = api_instance.create_stream(aid=aid, stream=stream)
        print("The response of StreamingApi->create_stream:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling StreamingApi->create_stream: %s\n" % e)

```
