These APIs have been automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).
Hence, we only allow contributions to a few non-autogenerated resources under `thousandeyes-sdk-core/`.

# Getting started

In case you'd like to submit your contribution, the following steps must be followed:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

# How to report a bug
