# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of UnitsByTests from a JSON string
units_by_tests_instance = UnitsByTests.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(UnitsByTests.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
units_by_tests_dict = units_by_tests_instance.to_dict()
