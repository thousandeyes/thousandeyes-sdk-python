# thousandeyes-sdk-credentials
Manage credentials for transaction tests using the Credentials API.

The following permissions are required to access Credentials API operations:

* `Settings Tests Read` for read operations.
* `Settings Tests Update` for write operations.
* `View sensitive data in web transaction scripts` to view the encrypted value property of credentials.
* `Settings Tests Create Transaction (Tx) Tests` to create credentials.

For more information about credentials, see [Working With Secure Credentials](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/browser-synthetics/transaction-tests/getting-started/working-with-secure-credentials).

## Getting Started

Please follow the installation procedure and then run the following:

```python

import thousandeyes_sdk.core
import thousandeyes_sdk.credentials
from thousandeyes_sdk.core.exceptions import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.thousandeyes.com/v7"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = thousandeyes_sdk.core.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with thousandeyes_sdk.core.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = thousandeyes_sdk.credentials.CredentialsApi(api_client)
    credential_request = thousandeyes_sdk.credentials.CredentialRequest() # CredentialRequest | 
    aid = '1234' # str | A unique identifier associated with your account group. You can retrieve your `AccountGroupId` from the `/account-groups` endpoint. Note that you must be assigned to the target account group. Specifying this parameter without being assigned to the target account group will result in an error response. (optional)

    try:
        # Create credential
        api_response = api_instance.create_credential(credential_request, aid=aid)
        print("The response of CredentialsApi->create_credential:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling CredentialsApi->create_credential: %s\n" % e)

```
