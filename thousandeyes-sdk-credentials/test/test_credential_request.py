    Credentials API

    Manage credentials for transaction tests using the Credentials API.  The following permissions are required to access Credentials API endpoints:  * `Settings Tests Read` for read operations. * `Settings Tests Update` for write operations. * `View sensitive data in web transaction scripts` to view the encrypted value property of credentials. * `Settings Tests Create Transaction (Tx) Tests` to create credentials.  For more information about credentials, see [Working With Secure Credentials](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/browser-synthetics/transaction-tests/getting-started/working-with-secure-credentials).
